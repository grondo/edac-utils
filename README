EDAC (Error Detection and Correction) is a set of Linux kernel
modules that handle reporting of hardware-related errors. Currently
these modules mainly handle detection of ECC memory errors for many
x86 and x86-64 chipsets and PCI bus parity errors.

The edac-utils project currently has three components: libedac,
edac-util, and edac-ctl. The libedac library presents a standard
API for reading EDAC error counts and other information from sysfs,
and edac-util uses this API to generate standard reports from the
commandline. The edac-ctl utility is a perl script which uses config
files to load the appropriate EDAC driver for a given chipset and
register motherboard DIMM labels if they are configured. An init
script is also provided which uses edac-ctl to initialize EDAC at
system startup.
